# inflection-sr
Code that generates inflected forms of nouns in Serbian. To use the library one needs to have a lexicon with:

* Noun form in nominative (singular and plural)
* Gender of the noun

Rules for noun declination were found at this [blog](http://pspasojevic.blogspot.com/2013/04/blog-post_1622.html).

Some of the sound transition [rules](https://sites.google.com/site/vavilonskakulasrpskijezik/jezik-gramat/glasovne-promene) that need to be applied to the declination changes.
